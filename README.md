# flutter_proj_2024_BLoC
Our Flutter 2024 project has the title of Hotel Booking. last semester we did a website for it and now we get the chance to build a mobile app for it. we added a feature that is getting feedback from the user. we used BLoC for the state management and also organized the structure using DDD rather than Firebase.
